      <h2>Definitions of yoga</h2>
      <h3>There is no single definition of yoga. In order to experience truth through yoga, we must study its classical
        definitions and reflect on our own understanding of it.</h3>
      <p>At its most practical level yoga is a process of becoming more aware of who we are. Yoga techniques facilitate
        balance and health, and unfold our dormant potential. Yoga allows us to be more aware of ourselves and feel
        connected. As such, yoga is a process of self-discovery. This leads us to self-mastery and self-realization.</p>
      <p>Yoga is a science, that is, it is a body of techniques that lead us to consciously connect with ourselves and
        with life, the experience of yoga. As yoga is a science, there is no dogma or belief system attached to it. Yoga
        simply tells us to do a certain practice and then to feel the effect of that practice.</p>
      <p>In Sanskrit, the word ‘yoga’ is used to signify any form of connection. In a philosophical sense, however, yoga
        means the conscious connection of the limited little egoic self with the unlimited, eternal, higher Self.</p>
      <p>The great sage Patanjali, in the system of Raja Yoga, gave one of the best definitions of yoga. He said, ‘Yoga
        is the blocking (nirodha) of mental modifications (chitta vritti) so that the seer (drashta) re-identifies with
        the (higher) Self.</p>
      <p>The definition of yoga in the Hatha Yoga texts is the union of the upward force (prana) and the downward force
        (apana) at the navel center (manipura chakra).</p>
      <p>The definition of yoga in kundalini yoga is the union of the mental current (ida) and the pranic current
        (pingala) in the third eye (ajna chakra) or at the base chakra (muladhara chakra).</p>
